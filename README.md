# REMOTE-ADMINISTRATION
This mini project demonstrates and implements remote administration using NodeJS.
Make sure you have latest version of NodeJs. If not download from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
First execute `node repl_server.js` and then execute `node repl_client.js`. And keep both of them running.
Currently, it's designed to work with only particular port only wiz. 8080. Type anything in the repl_client.js terminal and it will execute it on repl_server.js and produce the output on repl_client.js.
